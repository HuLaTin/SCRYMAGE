14 Magic: The Gathering cards
6–7 Commons
In one third of Play Boosters, one of these commons will be replaced by a card from the FINAL FANTASY Through the Ages bonus sheet. Cards from the bonus sheet aren't found in the wildcard or traditional foil slot in Play Boosters.
You can receive an uncommon (63.25%), rare (29.75%), or mythic rare (7%) FINAL FANTASY Through the Ages bonus sheet card.
3 Uncommons
Of these uncommons, 0.3% will be a double-faced uncommon borderless woodblock or borderless character card.
One of those uncommons—Cid, Timeless Artificer—has 15 different alternate-art variants. Cid, Timeless Artificer appears at the same rate as other uncommons, and all variants of the card appear at equal rates. Since there are 109 uncommons that can appear in this slot, any given uncommon has a 0.9% chance to be Cid, Timeless Artificer.
